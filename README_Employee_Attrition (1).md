# Employee Attrition Analysis üìä

This project aims to analyze the factors that contribute to employee attrition (turnover) using data visualization and machine learning techniques. By identifying key patterns and predictors, businesses can take proactive steps to improve employee retention.

## üìÅ Project Overview

- **Goal**: Predict whether an employee will leave the company based on various features (job role, satisfaction, salary, etc.)
- **Tools Used**:
  - Python (Pandas, NumPy)
  - Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
  - Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree)
  - Jupyter Notebook

---

## üìå Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning & Exploration**
   - Checked for missing values
   - Performed statistical summaries
2. **Visualization**
   - Bar charts, heatmaps, histograms to understand trends
3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Converted categorical variables to numerical
4. **Modeling**
   - Built classification models to predict attrition
   - Evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix
5. **Insights**
   - Job Satisfaction, Overtime, and Age strongly impact attrition

## üìà Sample Visuals

- **Attrition by Job Role**  
- **Impact of Overtime on Attrition**  
- **Correlation Heatmap of Employee Features**

*(Visuals included in the notebook)*

## üß† Conclusion

- Employees with low satisfaction and high overtime are more likely to leave.
- Data-driven HR strategies can help reduce attrition risk.
